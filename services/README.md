## Introduction

The `services` directory contains individual microservices that collectively make up the backend of the Brewhub application. Each microservice focuses on a specific domain, allowing for isolation and scalability of functionalities.

## Benefits of Microservices

- **Modularity**: Microservices allow for the independent development, deployment, and scaling of different components of the application.
- **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its specific requirements, leading to better resource utilization.
- **Flexibility**: Technologies and frameworks can be chosen based on the specific needs of each microservice.
- **Isolation**: A failure in one microservice does not necessarily impact the entire application, enhancing fault tolerance.
